# Day 1 - Next Challenge

## Welcome to Day 1!

Hello and welcome to day 1. As part of the CISS, last week, you provided us with the area and perimeter of the underground bunker.

We sent a ground team to search the bunker. Inside, we found a secured door, with a keypad next to it. The keypad only contains *numbers greater than 0*.

Next to the keypad was a taped piece of paper. Our cryptography teams tell us that the keypad access code is hidden in this paper. Meanwhile, our intelligence team tells us that the numbers must be in DESCENDING ORDER to find the right access code.

We need to recover the keypad access code from the encrypted password written on the paper.

## Mission

Find and print all the NUMBERS greater than 0 from the written encrypted passwordin DESCENDING order.

## Mission Resources

- [Print Function](https://github.com/mwcsc/documentation/blob/master/python/01-print-function.md)
- [In-built Math Functions](https://github.com/mwcsc/documentation/blob/master/pyhon/02-inbuilt-math-functions.md)
- [For Loop](https://github.com/mwcsc/documentation/blob/master/python/05-for-loop.md)
## Information:

- The keypad only accepts numbers GREATER than 0
- The access code is in DESCENDING order
- The access code is made of ONLY NUMBERS

## Values:

Encrypted Password: jh0g45j0jfgm40fghy7ut03d20fhn0gf400057q0wd12vcx4089pyi231400gjh0

## Expected output format:

- Integer Values (no decimals, no rounding)
- No units or words, just the numbers
- No trailing newlines

Example:

```
12345
```
