# Day 1 -The Second Challenge

## Welcome to Day 1

Hello and welcome to day 1. In your last mission, you discovered an abandoned mine. After you found the area and perimeter of the mine, we sent a ground team in to find the scientist.

They reported finding a locked door, with a sign on it. The sign contained three scrambled passwords. We need to know the length of these passwords, so we can know what they are used for.


## Mission

Create a program that finds the length of each scrambled password.
